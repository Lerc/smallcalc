Calculator visibility can be toggled from the applet icon,

The calculator is small, draggable and sits above windows.
This makes it ideal for doing calculations while working in other applications.

The display on the calculator can be used as a text entry field enabling easy editing of expressions.  The expressions are evaluated using [math.js](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/).

You may use the Up and Down cursor keys to navigate history while the edit field is selected.
